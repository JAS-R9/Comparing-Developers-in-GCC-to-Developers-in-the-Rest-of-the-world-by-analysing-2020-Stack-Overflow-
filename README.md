# Comparing Developers in GCC to Developers in the Rest of the world by analysing 2020 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey
This repository has a quick analysis comparing the developers in GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) to developers in the Rest of the world using 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. 

# Libraries Used:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib.pyplot

# Project Motivation:
I am a developer in Saudi Arabia which is part of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) who studied Software Engineering degreee in the UK. I couldn't help but notice the slighly different approach to development between my days in the UK and my days in Saudi. The GCC countries are not known for taking a lead in terms of developing new solutions but rather adopting solutions and enhancing them. This has left me personally slightly disappointed since I wanted to work on introducing new solutions that will change the indsutry like the ones introduced by Google, Amazon, and Uber.

I wanted to use the 2020 stack overflow annual developer survey to answer some of the questions that I think are related to my situaition.

1. How many developers in GCC develop for a hobby? and how does that compare to the rest of the world?
2. How satisfied are those developers in their current jobs in comparison to developers in the rest of the world?
3. How do dissatisfied developers in GCC compare to developers in rest of the world in terms of seeking new job opportunity?
